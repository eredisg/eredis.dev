[PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - IDE for PHP & Web Development. Includes intelligent auto-completion and productivity tools like built-in CSV viewer, DB Viewer, and PHPUnit.

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - Improved CMD/Powershell terminal that allows split panes & better customization

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) - Universal database tool that is great to view large amount of data compared to the normal command line.

[Burp Suite Professional](https://portswigger.net/burp) - Application security testing tool used to find vulnerabilities within an application.

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API development tool used to test APIs. I use this alongside Burp Suite Pro.
